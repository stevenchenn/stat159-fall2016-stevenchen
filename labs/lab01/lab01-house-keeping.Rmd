### About Us

- GSI (introduce yourself)
- Students (introduce yourselves):
	+ What's your (preferred) name?
	+ What are you studying?
	+ What would you like to do when finishing college?
- The following activity may look weird to most of you, but it can help us 
tremendously to better remember you.
- On a piece of scratch paper, please write your name and tell us something _unique!_ about you
	+ GOOD example: "I speak 5 languages: english, spanish, french, italian, portuguese"
	+ GOOD example: "I'm one of seven siblings, and the only who has finished high school"
	+ BORING example: "I think my name is pretty unique"
	+ BORING example: "I like cats"


### Required Software

We are going to be using several tools along this course. Which means that you 
will have to install the following programs. If you run into any installation 
problems google it first or check youtube videos or ask your neighbor; if that 
doesn't work then ask the GSI or the instructor:

- __Git__ (for version control)
	- [Downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- __GitHub__ (for project hosting)
	- You will also need to open an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/) (unless you already have one): [https://github.com/join](https://github.com/join)
	- Wisely choose your username! (be professional)
- __pandoc__ (a universal document converter)
	- [Installing](http://pandoc.org/installing.html)
- __R__ (statistical & data analysis software)
	- [Mac OS X](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/)
	- [Windows](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/)
	- [Linux](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/)
- __RStudio__ (IDE for R)
	- [Downloads](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
- __Tex/LaTeX__ (typesetting system; the installation takes time)
	- [MacTeX](https://tug.org/mactex/) (for Mac OS X)
	- [MikTeX](http://miktex.org/download) (for Windows)


### Get to know your neighbors

One cornerstone of the course involves __Collaboration__. Among other
things, there will be three major collaborative tasks:

- In-class presentation (in teams of 4, and based on an assigned reading)
- 2nd project (in teams of 2)
- 3rd project (in teams of 4---this is the final project) 

Take some time to introduce yourself to your lab neighbors. Chances are
that, for one or all of the collaborative projects in the course, you 
may end up working with them (and hopefully becoming _BFF's_ too).
